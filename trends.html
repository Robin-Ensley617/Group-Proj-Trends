            <h3>Cinnamon Challenge</h3>
            <p>The Cinnamon Challenge became a hit around 2017 as many attempted to beat others records. This challenge tests how long users can last without water after swallowing a spoonfull of cinnamon powder. Many fail as they are immediately engulfed in clouds of cinnamon smoke! Although comical, this challenge is extremly dangerous causing irritation to the throat and inflammation to the lungs. This great irritation to the lungs from the cinnamon can lead to pneumonia, a collapsed lung, and respiratory damage.   </p>

            <h2>The Dangers</h2>
            <p>With millions of likes, shares and views, social media trends can be a source of entertainment and newfound connections with others. In addition, these trends are great ways to promote and grow an online audience or even advertise buisnesses and products. Yet some social media trends pose great risks that are sadly replicated by many youth on these online platforms. Throughout the years, many that have participated in some dangerous trends experience extensive injuries, hospitilization, and even death.
                One online trend called the Blackout Challenge shows users holding their breath until they passout from a lack of oxygen. This extended lack of oxygen can lead to brain damage or even death. </p>
